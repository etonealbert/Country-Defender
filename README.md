## Description
Defend a country at the center of your screen from invaders in pickups. Swiftly tap on these vehicles to detonate them before they reach the country's borders. If they do, parts of the nation vanish. As levels progress, the pickups increase in speed and numbers. Test your reflexes and strategy in this fast-paced mobile game.

## Testing:
Unit and UI tests should be written as part of tickets. Consideration of testing while programming can help lead to a cleaner and more intentional codebase. We should do our best to maintain a minimum 80% code coverage.

### UI testing resources:

## SwiftLint:
SwiftLint will help maintain a consistent style across the codebase. Some of the default rules are a bit *too* opinionated for my tastes, so I'll be removing those, and am open to talking about other rules we think are over the top.

- The rules for this project are located at `/.swiftlint.yml`
- Rule documentation can be found [here](https://realm.github.io/SwiftLint/rule-directory.html).

### Setup:
1. If you have homebrew setup, SwiftLint can be easily installed in the terminal by running `brew install swiftlint`
2. SwiftLint is already configured within the project. 
3. More information around SwiftLint can be found on its [GitHub](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
